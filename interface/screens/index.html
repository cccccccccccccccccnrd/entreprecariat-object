        <h4>Precariat</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The precariat establishes by the group of people suffering from precarity. Precarity is a difficult and much discussed term, but appears to find common ground in describing an existence without predictability or security mostly connected to work and employment. It also  encompasses the direct psychological implications often referred to as a way of cognitive precarity. The precarious condition is marked by a long and vibrant discours based in economics and sociology, but enters the medial discussion more and more, through newly created means of networked job structures and communication through the internet. The british economist Guy Standing calls it an emerging social class with the title “The New Dangerous Class” arguing that it roots higher violence, hatred and current alt-right movements. But Standing also sees a dormant potential and divides the precariats population into two groups. The ones who fell victim to it and the ones seeing the rise of a new establishment, which could socially and politically organize and act.</p>

        <h4>Inclusion/Exclusion</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Inclusion can not exist without exclusion and vice versa. The two operations can only be observed in their engaged and permanent dependence. In my exploration the initial clear separation between inclusion and exclusion blurred progressively.
          This installation looks at the concept of work and employment in the age of the internet with focusing on the growing entanglement of entrepreneurialism and new shapes of the precariat. Through analyzing the phenomenon of group control systems within the discourse of interface cultures a specific type of (fake, new) engagement towards work becomes visible.
          The initial motivation for this project came through an excursion to mexico city, where the conversations with design students and uber drivers had compelling similarities — being precarious.

        <h4>Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneurialism</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Since successful entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are stars to the same degree as pop music and sport ones, the utilization of Foucault’s homo oeconomicus rose to a new level. It seems normal to look at their diets, quotes, habits and way of being to study them and imitate them to learn from their success to eventually morph into an entrepreneur oneself. Concepts like “Personal brand” and “Self-packaging” are a must have in the tool belt of the modern silicon valley fanboi. But being an entrepreneur is everything but easy, according to Viennese economist Schumpeter one has to possess what he calls “Unternehmergeist” (Entrepreneurial spirit) to be a successful entrepreneur. For Schumpeter the entrepreneur is placed at the top of society and can only be reached by some. The ones that don’t fear the risk and are willing to pursue their calling of managing a business to make profit, only then true innovation is possible.</p>

        <h4>Entreprecariat</h4>
        <br>
        <p>These two concepts get interesting when seen from the perspective of the Millennial generation. For them the two seemingly never existed apart from each other. Either way being confronted with automation hypes or post-work concepts like universal basic income or the full on flexible lean startup CEO route. Like so often, again the only constant seems to be change and the necessity to adapt to that continual change. The concept of work life balance is hardly understood, because anyway one should find and dedicate one's passion, morph the two to one — á la “never work a day in your life again”. Most probably the two were cognitive wise never separated in the first place. <br><br> Exactly this happening is described in detail in Silvio Lorusso’s work “Entreprecariat”. The writer and artists analyzes the current development in the discourse describing the ever blurring line between the Precariat and Entrepreneurship with creating the portmanteau of the Entreprecariat. Within his work it becomes clear that today entrepreneurialism is filled with precarity and the precariat is directly tied to entrepreneurial tendencies. It showcases that the common ground between the two are tied to the autonomous self, having to cope with precariat’s continuous change and entrepreneurial risks and uncertainty. The hyper individualization of today's neoliberalism detaches work from a societal and constitutional concept and binds it and all its importance to the individual. “Those who are now twenty or thirty years old are intimately aware that the center of gravity of their professional identity is located within themselves, rather than in the companies with which they temporarily collaborate”. Lorusso continues with citing the management guru Peter Drucker who sees no way around society as a whole becoming entrepreneurial to successfully drive innovation. Lorusso sees Schumpeter’s pyramid as reversed. For him the pyramid dissolved and entrepreneurialism leaked into every aspect of everyday life. “Everyone is called to — or coerced into — free enterprise [...]. This is the general sense of what we call entreprecariat”</p>

        <h4>Precariat</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A similar view has the EuroMayDay (A europe wide transnational demonstration of precarious people) organizer Alex Foti. In his work “General Theory of the Precariat” from 2017 he calls to form a global union to escape the fear of plummeting into the social abyss. Just like Standing, Foti sees the optimistic side of the precariat with its people and their organization. But who are the people in the precariat? And who is a precarious worker? This is where Foti makes an interesting point. Until recently the precariat was mostly connected to low income jobs and with a middle-aged majority of the global south. But Foti shows a different precariat. For him precariousness is the new reality affecting more and more parts of the job economy. A big part of Foti’s precariat consists of young people from metropolitan areas belonging to what he calls the the creative class. Ranging from freelance graphic designers to programmers and artists. For him the precariat is underpaid, under-employed and under-protected, but also over-educated and therefore over-exploited. In this work it is important to understand that the precariat is not only the poor working class, just like Foti it includes the creative class and within particular design students and graduates.</p>

        <h4>Don’t Get a Job... Make a Job</h4>
        <br>
        <p>As already touched on before, entrepreneurship becomes dangerous when it turns into entrepreneurialism. When the highly rational, suppressing and exploitative tendencies are turned from a methodology and practice to a way of being. In contrast to entrepreneurship, entrepreneurialism comes with a specific value system, which embodies the judgement of oneself and others and helps to navigate life and its decisions. Through the normalization and embodiment in everyday life, the rationalization of running a business is reflected into personal values. The entrepreneurial mindset turns into an entrepreneurial imperative: to continuously upgrade one’s personal brand through taking risks and taking individual action to stabilize oneself and barely escape social precarity. This paradox is deeply rooted and enforces itself in the gig economy of today. Lorusso points out this vicious feedback loop with stating that “entrepreneurialism generates precarity, which in turn requires entrepreneurialism”.</p>

        <h4>Don’t Get a Job... Make a Job</h4>
        <br>
        <p>“Don’t Get a Job… Make a Job: How to make it as a creative graduate” is a so self-claimed “inspirational advice” book, which gives graduates of creative studies strategies to help and navigate within the economic instability of design graduates. The book is filled with advice and how tos, making it the epitome of the entrepreneurial imperative. The cover of the book reads 25 calls of action, including “Put yourself out there, Learn from your idols, Swim against the tide, Move mountains, Imagine best-case scenarios, Exploit your interest, Reinvent yourself”. Reading the cover seemingly inflicts more precarity than entrepreneurial motivation. The strategies of the book also seem to represent essential parts of entrepreneurial ideology, which are not to be forgotten in the discussion about the entrepreneurial imperative. The strategy “Learn from your idols” does a good job in reflecting the wide spread obsession of entrepreneurial stars. The possibility of social media to share one’s private life to the public, turned the life of certain Elon Musk’s into a fetish. People follow their diets, analyze their sleeping patterns and train to imitate their habits. But of course “It should not be looked upon as ‘spying,’ but as researching, training, and groundwork”, says Gem Barton in her book. Turning even the personal procrastination time on Twitter into a stream of training in benefit of the personal brand. The second strategy “Imagine best-case scenarios” represents the most important narrative about the entrepreneurial mind. Management consultant David Binetti’s “Phrenology of an Entrepreneur'' shows an infographic of the mind being divided into certain key characteristics of the entrepreneur. The most prominent being the “ability to create [one's] own reality”. It stands for the probably most crucial asset of the entrepreneur: to ignorantly visualize a self-envisioned future or also known as “Fake it till you make it”. Often used in business operations, fake it till you make it is the process of advertising and marketing of a product, which is not finished yet to sustain further resources and funding, so that the product will eventually be realized. But of course the expression turned to an frequently used aphorism signaling: pretending to be happy, until one is truly happy — manifesting the vicious self-optimizing circle through ignorant optimism of the Lorusso’s entreprecariat into everyday life. Which leads us to the third point: “Create positive change”. Of course positive being the crucial part of the proposed strategy, because just to create change would not be enough. In the entrepreneurs world everything is concealed with positivity. The entrepreneurial mind cannot grasp the concept of negativity, because in the end it's all about the right attitude, right? Working in the startup world or co-working space, it is hard to get around inspirational and motivational quotes. Especially around the famous work of Anthony Burrill. The graphic designer’s famous piece is a 300€ print reading the beautifully set typography: “Work hard and be nice to people”. In these spaces only positive vibes are allowed and best no criticizing, especially not the work itself. Just do what the mantra says: work hard and it would be best to not talk in the meantime. Serving the neoliberalist system with being a motivated passive worker. Optimism is turned into an imperative and any shape of negativity is contempt.
